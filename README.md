# XMLToLua
An XML to Lua file converter, made for my text rendering module [Text+](https://github.com/AlexanderLindholt/TextPlus).<br>
*Written in Lua.*

# Tutorial
Download the latest zip file.<br>
Unzip/extract the zip file.<br>
You should get a folder with a `Convert.exe` file inside.

Put an XML format file into the folder where the `Convert.exe` file is.<br>
*Accepted file types: XML, FNT, TXT.*

Then simply open the `Convert.exe` file.<br>
It might warn you, saying it might be a threat (virus). This is simply because I haven't registered the file, as it's extremely expensive to do so. The code is open-source.

After a few short seconds, you should see a new `.lua` file.
